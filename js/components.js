  "full_description": "Multiple members of the Duggar family reacted after Josh Duggar was convicted on two counts of receiving and possessing child pornography Thursday. Josh was immediately taken into custody Thursday after his guilty verdict. The former reality TV star faces up to 20 years and up to $250,000 fines for each count. Josh's cousin Amy King tweeted that 'justice has been served' following the verdict announcement.'May the juror’s and Judge Brooks seek healing / counseling from all that was exposed to them,' her statement on Twitter began. 'May the children grow up with real Godly men as father figures who will guide and protect them. May the people who were once in disbelief have their eyes opened for the first time.' 'May the daughters who were abused feel validated,' she continued. 'You are truly beautiful and worthy of love. May there be intense counseling / healing. May there be wisdom for all those involved on how to move forward. Thank you Jesus. Justice has been served.' Amy King's mom, Deanna Duggar, also reacted. 'JUSTICE WAS SERVED!!! Praying for all involved in the case!!!' she wrote on her Instagram Story along with several praying hand emojis. Josh's wife Anna Duggar was seen leaving the courtroom emotionless. Anna wore a black peacoat over a matching black dress. Following the verdict, Duggar's defense attorney said the team respects the jury's verdict but does plan to appeal. 'We appreciate the jury’s lengthy deliberations, we respect the jury’s verdict, and we intend to appeal,' defense attorneys Justin Gelfand, Ian Murphy and Travis Story said.",

'We appreciate the jury's lengthy deliberations, we respect the jury's verdict, and we intend to appeal,' said Justin Gelfand, Duggar's attorney, in a statement. Joshua Duggar will be released from jail as he awaits trial for child pornography charges, federal judge rules Duggar was arrested on April 29 and arraigned on April 30 on federal charges of receipt and possession of child pornography, according to the US Attorney's Office in the Western District of Arkansas. He allegedly downloaded material that depicted the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, the US attorney's office said in a statement. He has pleaded not guilty to the two charges. Homeland Security Special Agent Gerald Faulkner testified on the investigation into Duggar. Faulkner detailed to the court that pornography containing young children was found on a desktop computer at Duggar's business in Springdale, Arkansas. One of the files, according to Faulkner, depicted children ranging from 18 months to 12 years of age. Faulkner said in his 11 years of being an investigator those images are 'in the top five of the worst I have ever had to examine.' Duggar is the oldest son of Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, whose large family and devout conservative Christian upbringing were the subject of the TLC show '19 Kids and Counting.' The show was canceled in 2015 in the wake of allegations that Josh Duggar molested girls when he was a teenager. He was never charged in relation to those allegations.

Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar posted a statement on their family website about the 'very serious accusations' their son is facing. 'We appreciate your continued prayers for our family at this time. The accusations brought against Joshua today are very serious. It is our prayer that the truth, no matter what it is, will come to light, and that this will all be resolved in a timely manner. We love Josh and Anna and continue to pray for their family,' they said.",

    "full_description": "Washington — The death of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole at 98 brought condolences and tributes from elected officials across the political spectrum, who praised the late senator for a life committed to public service. Dole, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in February, died in his sleep early Sunday morning, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation said. Funeral arrangements have not yet been announced, though there will be ceremonies in Kansas and Washington, according to his website. President Joe Biden praised the former Senate majority leader as a \"man to be admired by Americans\" and said the late senator had \"an unerring sense of integrity and honor.\" \"Bob was an American statesman like few in our history. A war hero and among the greatest of the Greatest Generation,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And to me, he was also a friend whom I could look to for trusted guidance, or a humorous line at just the right moment to settle frayed nerves. I will miss my friend.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lauded Dole's service in the U.S. Army, followed by his nearly three decades in the Senate, which he said is \"better off for Bob's stewardship.\" \"Bob was a steady leader and a legislative master. He unlocked both conservative victories and big bipartisan achievements,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"His Dust Bowl roots fueled a special commitment to vulnerable Americans, and sure enough, Bob's work on food security, veterans' issues, and the rights of disabled Americans have continued to have an especially lasting impact.\" The Kentucky Republican continued: \"Whatever their politics, anyone who saw Bob Dole in action had to admire his character and his profound patriotism. Those of us who were lucky to know Bob well ourselves admired him even more. A bright light of patriotic good cheer burned all the way from Bob's teenage combat heroics through his whole career in Washington through the years since. It still shone brightly, undimmed, to his last days.\" Former President George W. Bush said in a statement the Bush family benefited from Dole's friendship, including the late former President George H.W. Bush. \"This good man represented the finest of American values,\" Bush said. \"He defended them in uniform during World War II. He advanced them in the United States Senate. And he lived them out as a father, husband, and friend.\" Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, remembered Dole as a \"giant of the Senate,\" while Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, tweeted that he thinks of Dole when he thinks of the greatest generation. To honor Dole, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff, her deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said.

    "full_description": "Bob Dole, who overcame disabling war wounds to become a sharp-tongued Senate leader from Kansas, a Republican presidential candidate and then a symbol and celebrant of his dwindling generation of World War II veterans, has died. He was 98. His wife, Elizabeth Dole, posted the announcement Sunday on Twitter. “It is with heavy hearts we announce that Senator Robert Joseph Dole died early this morning in his sleep. At his death, at age 98, he had served the United States of America faithfully for 79 years. More information coming soon. #RememberingBobDole,” read the tweet. Dole announced in February 2021 that he’d been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. During his 36-year career on Capitol Hill, Dole became one of the most influential legislators and party leaders in the Senate, combining a talent for compromise with a caustic wit, which he often turned on himself but didn’t hesitate to turn on others, too. He shaped tax policy, foreign policy, farm and nutrition programs and rights for the disabled, enshrining protections against discrimination in employment, education and public services in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Today’s accessible government offices and national parks, sidewalk ramps and the sign-language interpreters at official local events are just some of the more visible hallmarks of his legacy and that of the fellow lawmakers he rounded up for that sweeping civil rights legislation 30 years ago. Dole devoted his later years to the cause of wounded veterans, their fallen comrades at Arlington National Cemetery and remembrance of the fading generation of World War II vets. Thousands of old soldiers massed on the National Mall in 2004 for what Dole, speaking at the dedication of the World War II Memorial there, called “our final reunion.” He’d been a driving force in its creation. “Our ranks have dwindled,” he said then. “Yet if we gather in the twilight it is brightened by the knowledge that we have kept faith with our comrades.” Long gone from Kansas, Dole made his life in the capital, at the center of power and then in its shadow upon his retirement, living all the while at the storied Watergate complex. When he left politics and joined a law firm staffed by prominent Democrats, he joked that he brought his dog to work so he would have another Republican to talk to. He tried three times to become president. The last was in 1996, when he won the Republican nomination only to see President Bill Clinton reelected. He sought his party’s presidential nomination in 1980 and 1988 and was the 1976 GOP vice presidential candidate on the losing ticket with President Gerald Ford.",

      "full_description": "Shares of Lucid Motors tanked Monday morning after the electric car maker disclosed that its been slapped with a subpoena as part of an investigation into the merger that took Lucid public earlier this year. “On December 3, 2021, [Lucid] received a subpoena from the [Securities and Exchange Commission] requesting the production of certain documents related to an investigation by the SEC,” Lucid, which was formerly known as Atieva, said Monday in a disclosure filed with the SEC. “Although there is no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination between the Company (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp. IV) and Atieva, Inc. and certain projections and statements.” Lucid said it’s “cooperating fully” with the investigation. Churchill did not immediately return The Post’s request for comment. The stock plummeted about 14 percent and was last seen trading at $40.72 per share in pre-market trading. Before that, Lucid stock had roughly doubled in November amid a surge in all-electric car stocks, giving Lucid a market valuation of some $76 billion, about the same as auto industry giant Ford — even though Lucid only recently began delivery of its first cars. Lucid went public earlier this year through one of the largest ever special purpose acquisition company deals, in which a publicly-traded blank-check company merges with a privately held firm, which then takes the blank-check company’s spot on the public markets. Lucid went public through a merger with veteran dealmaker Michael Klein’s Churchill Capital Corp. IV that gave Lucid a pro-forma equity value of $24 billion. SPAC mergers exploded in popularity over the past two years and became especially common in the electric vehicle start-up space, with Nikola, Fisker and Lordstown all merging with SPACs. But SPACs are frequently criticized by those who say it’s a way for companies to go public while avoiding the investor scrutiny of an initial public offering and offering rosy projects that aren’t necessarily tied to reality. Since going public, both Nikola and Lordstown have both become the targets of federal investigations, giving fodder to critics of the financial instrument. It’s not clear exactly what aspects of Lucid’s merger with Churchill Capital is being investigated, though the SEC earlier this year suggested they would step up scrutiny of accounting practices in SPAC mergers, temporarily putting a freeze on the hot market. But in the following months, SPACs have once again gained steam, delivering dozens of companies to the public markets.",

      "content": "A few inches’ difference in height may not seem like a problem for many couples. But when it comes to filming elaborate stunts together in a superhero movie, that gap can pose a challenge. Spider-Man: No Way Home actors Zendaya and Tom Holland ran into this very issue, as Zendaya is slightly taller than her co-star. During a recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show, the two admitted that their height difference made scenes where Spider-Man saves MJ somewhat awkward. Check out the interview clip below. ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ stars Zendaya and Tom Holland | David M. Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage What is the height difference between Zendaya and Tom Holland? Holland might jokingly consider Zendaya a giraffe, but their height difference isn’t really that drastic. According to IMDb, Holland is 5’8″. Meanwhile, his girlfriend and co-star stands two inches taller at 5’10”. Holland isn’t exactly “short” — the average male height is about 5’9″ — but he does appear that way compared to other Marvel actors like Robert Downey, Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Jon Favreau (Happy Hogan). In the past, some fans have also pointed out that MCU’s Spider-Man is “smol.” Zendaya and Tom Holland admitted their height difference made ‘Spider-Man’ stunts awkward On The Graham Norton Show, Zendaya depicted a Spider-Man: No Way Home scene where Spider-Man swings in to save MJ and takes her to a bridge. Then, he sets her down gently and walks away. The scene might look seamless on the big screen, but it appeared a bit unusual on set whenever the MJ actor’s feet touched the ground first. “Because of our height difference, if we’re on the same point — we were attached — I would land before him. My feet obviously hit the ground before he does,” Zendaya said, as seen above. Holland added that in some takes, Zendaya would actually have to be the one to catch his leg when it swung out after his landing. “I’m the superhero. I’m supposed to look cool,” Holland joked. Still, Zendaya said the superhero actor took the awkward landings like a champ. He was appreciative whenever she caught him. “It’s so nice to be caught for a change,” Holland added. Zendaya worried about being taller than her co-star when she landed the role Got a question for @TomHolland1996 and @Zendaya? Send us your fan Q's for the @SpiderManMovie stars using #AskTomAndZendaya #SpiderManNoWayHome pic.twitter.com/Vcv83kqogl— IMDb (@IMDb) December 1, 2021 Zendaya was concerned that her height would impact getting the role of MJ when she auditioned for Spider-Man: Homecoming. She told Variety in 2017 that she feared the casting directors would focus on the height difference during her chemistry read with Holland. “I was worried because he’s so much shorter than me. I was like, ‘Damn it! It’s going to be weird because I’m super tall,'” she said. Thankfully, she and Holland did the chemistry read sitting down. Zendaya passed with flying colors, and her height was never a casting issue. The height difference might make things awkward, but at least it provides some hilarious anecdotes for Holland and Zendaya to share with fans. Spider-Man: No Way Home hits theaters on Dec. 17.

De Blasio, whose term is set to expire in a matter of weeks, broke the news during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\" Monday morning. BIDEN HIT WITH STRING OF LEGAL LOSSES ON VACCINE MANDATE, AS DOJ VOWS TO 'VIGOROUSLY DEFEND' IT IN COURT \"We’ve got omicron as a new factor, we’ve got the colder weather, which is going to really create additional challenges with the delta variant, we’ve got holiday gatherings,\" de Blasio said. \"We in NYC have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of COVID,\" de Blasio said. De Blasio described the move as a \"first in the nation measure,\" to cover all private sector employers in New York City with the requirement. The new mandate takes effect on Dec. 27. DE BLASIO HINTS NYC'S NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATION IN TIMES SQUARE RETURNING TO IN-PERSON \"We’re going to have other measures as well to focus on maximizing vaccinations quickly, so we can get ahead of omicron and all the other challenges we’re facing right now because of COVID,\" de Blasio said. De Blasio's office also said it is broadening \"Key to NYC,\" its program requiring proof of vaccination for indoor dining, fitness and entertainment--expanding the measure to include 5- to 11-year-olds. De Blasio's office said \"approximately 20%\" of that age group is vaccinated in New York City. \"Get that shot by 12/14 for our youngest New Yorkers,\" de Blasio's press secretary tweeted. The measure will also require proof of a second vaccine dose by 12/27. De Blasio's move comes while the Biden administration has faced a string of legal losses over its COVID-19 vaccine mandates, with a number of federal judges across the nation halting the implementation of the rules claiming overreach by the executive branch — as the Justice Department plans to \"vigorously defend\" the mandates in court. The Biden administration last month unveiled the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration COVID-19 vaccine rule, which required employers with more than 100 employees to ensure that all workers are either fully vaccinated or subject to weekly testing and mask wearing. The mandate also hit businesses that fail to comply with fines reaching as much as $14,000 per violation with the potential for multiple citations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld its stay on the mandate, OSHA suspended enforcement of the rule. Meanwhile, New York City's Mayor-elect Eric Adams is set to take de Blasio's post on Jan. 1.",

    "full_description": "All New York City employers will soon need to mandate that their workers present proof of vaccination against COVID-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. The outgoing mayor announced the policy during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” describing it as a “pre-emptive strike” against an expected surge in COVID cases this winter amid the emergence of the Omicron variant of the virus. The policy will go into effect Dec. 27. “We’re going to announce a first-in-the-nation measure,” de Blasio said. “Our health commissioner will announce the vaccine mandate for private sector employers across the board. All private-sector employers in New York City will be covered by this vaccine mandate.” Hizzoner added that the mandate is aimed at “maximizing vaccination quickly, so we can get ahead of Omicron and all the other challenges we’re facing right now.” Currently, only municipal employees are subject to a COVID-19 inoculation requirement, which took effect for most city workers in late October. Also Monday, de Blasio announced that two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will be required to enter many indoor businesses in the five boroughs — including bars, restaurants and fitness centers. The current iteration of the “Key to NYC” program requires just one vaccine dose . Additionally, children ages five to 11 will soon be required to receive at least one shot in a vaccine series to enter indoor establishments. Those policy adjustments will also take effect Dec. 27, the mayor said. The new measures come after de Blasio on Friday hinted he is considering adding more restrictive provisions to the Big Apple’s indoor venue vaccine rules.",

      "full_description": "With at least 16 states now reporting cases of the Omicron variant have been detected, there's still much more we don't know about the spread of the latest COVID-19 strain. So what does this mean for families and the fight against COVID-19 ? Here's what Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told \" Face the Nation .\" The first cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in the United States. How concerned should we be about this variant and do we know whether vaccines will work against it? It is important to take the emergence of this new strain seriously until we know more about it. What we don't know about Omicron right now far exceeds what we do know, but what we've learned so far is cause for concern. Omicron has more than 50 mutations. Many of them are in the spike protein region of the virus, which is the area targeted by our current vaccines and some of our treatments. That raises the question as to whether it will be able to evade our immune systems and the protections provided by either our current vaccines or prior COVID-19 infection. Over the next week or two, we should begin to have a clearer picture of whether that is in fact the case, as well as whether it causes more severe disease and is more transmissible than other strains. We shouldn't be surprised that cases of the Omicron variant have been discovered in the U.S. With Omicron already documented in more than 30 countries, it was only a matter of time before it arrived here. Viruses don't respect borders. There will be more Omicron cases to come. The scientists in South Africa who discovered the variant should be applauded for their speed and transparency in sharing this information with the world and allowing other scientists to quickly begin sequencing viral isolates—meaning samples from infected individuals—and studying its impact. Regardless of whether the Omicron variant causes a surge in COVID-19, we continue to lack control over the Delta variant, the current dominant strain. Delta is still killing nearly 1,000 people in America every single day. We cannot allow complacency to set in so that this loss of life becomes acceptable, especially when so many of these deaths are preventable. Our current vaccines work incredibly well against Delta, yet millions of people remain unvaccinated. Anyone eligible for any COVID-19 vaccine—whether it's a primary series, a third shot for people who are immunocompromised, or a booster shot for adults—should get those shots now as we head into the December holidays and the winter months. And whether it's Delta, Omicron, or any other variant, the public health playbook—masks in indoor public settings, testing, handwashing, ventilation—still provides extremely effective tools to manage this pandemic, but only if we choose to use them. Should we anticipate more variants after Omicron? Will this just be a part of our daily life living with COVID-19 strains? No one is entirely safe from COVID-19 until everyone is safe from COVID-19. Until COVID-19 transmission is under control everywhere—and unless and until vaccines are available and easily accessible for everyone around the globe—we can expect COVID-19 to continue to freely circulate, which will lead to additional new variants. A new strain that can elude our immune protection puts everybody at risk—even people who have been vaccinated or those who have had prior infection. Omicron may or may not turn out to be that kind of strain, but even if it isn't, a future strain that does so is entirely possible. While new variants could easily emerge in the United States, both Omicron and Delta originated outside our borders, and both swiftly found their way here. Walls and travel restrictions may slow the entry of a new virus for a short time, but they cannot prevent it. The world must treat this moment as a serious wakeup call when it comes to global vaccine equity. In the US, we are fortunate to have the means to provide vaccines and boosters to our entire eligible population. Other nations simply do not have the resources to do so, yet wealthy nations continue to hoard vaccines: the latest numbers show that approximately three-quarters of vaccines administered worldwide have been in high- and upper-middle income countries. Nearly half of the world's population remains unvaccinated. In Africa, population 1.4 billion, nearly 90% of the continent's population has yet to receive a single shot. As long as these types of inequities continue, new variants will have far too much time and space to spread and flourish. There is a moral, economic, and health imperative for the United States to redouble our own efforts and galvanize efforts by other nations to help vaccinate the world. It is a matter of equity that the world must not continue to ignore. When can school-age children in the U.S. expect to be eligible for boosters? Only those 18 and older are currently eligible for boosters. The CDC recently expanded its booster guidance, recommending that every adult eligible for a booster receives one. In light of the ongoing toll of Delta, and the unknowns around Omicron, I think that guidance makes sense. Pfizer recently announced that it will ask the FDA to authorize booster shots for its vaccine for 16- and 17-year olds. If the FDA, CDC, and their respective advisory committees think that's the way to go, families and healthcare providers should heed that advice. And if the science shows that the degree of protection starts to fall for vaccinated children over time, boosters for a broader swath of our younger population might become a reality. But we're not there yet. When it comes to children ages 5 and up, ensuring they receive their primary series of shots is where we must focus our energies and resources. As a pediatrician, I have seen how important it is for families to get their questions answered by a trusted healthcare provider. And when parents get to a \"yes\" on getting their kids vaccinated, we need to make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Every employer should offer paid leave benefits so parents and caregivers do not have to choose between getting their children vaccinated and earning a paycheck. Health experts appear divided on the issue of travel. With the holiday season in full swing, would you recommend against traveling with the Omicron variant now circulating? How should families approach gathering for holidays with small children, both vaccinated and unvaccinated? I felt extremely grateful to share Thanksgiving with my family and friends this year. We did so in a safe way by following CDC guidance. Thanks to the safety and effectiveness of our current vaccines and increased availability of home testing, Thanksgiving in 2021 was a lot more joyous for our family than it was in 2020, and we had the peace of mind that comes with doing things the right way. Too often, however, when it comes to returning to our normal lives, people are still viewing public health guidance as an enemy rather than an ally. When that guidance is discarded or ignored, especially during the holidays when a lot of people gather together, we all suffer the consequences. At this point, I don't see a reason to change my travel plans for the December holidays, but I recognize that each person has a different level of both actual risk as well as risk comfort. If it turns out that Omicron is more contagious than Delta, causes more severe infection, and poses a significant risk even to people who have been fully vaccinated, gathering for the holidays would be a lot riskier than it is now and likely would be discouraged. If, on the other hand, Omicron does not cause more severe infection and current vaccines continue to offer protection, gathering can be done pretty safely if we adhere to public health guidance. We should know the answers to those questions soon. A few days ago, President Biden announced stronger testing protocols for international travelers coming to the United States and extended the federal mask requirement for planes, trains, and other forms of public transportation. Irrespective of Omicron, those steps make a lot of sense given Delta's continued spread. I encourage families to follow CDC's guidance around holiday travel and any updates to that guidance that may be issued in the coming weeks as we learn more about Omicron. As a general principle, we should all be mindful of traveling to any location domestically or internationally where case rates are high and vaccination rates are low. The Omicron variant could hurt the economy as we enter the holiday season and the start of 2022. How important is getting the pandemic under control for our economic recovery? This pandemic has hit every community in America physically, emotionally, and economically. However, the pain has not been felt evenly across our nation and the recovery has been inequitable. The same populations that have been at disproportionate risk of suffering from COVID-19 —people of color and those who are paid low wages—are the same ones who continue to struggle the most economically . At various points during the pandemic, Congress has provided critical economic assistance to families that has prevented a dire economic situation from becoming truly catastrophic for many; in fact, thanks in large part to this increased support, the U.S. poverty rate actually declined in 2020. But providing temporary support that only gets us past an immediate public health threat is insufficient if we are to finally address the fundamental barriers to economic prosperity and health that still exist in America. The Build Back Better Act recently passed by the House of Representatives would be an important step forward in our efforts to provide everyone in America with the opportunity to live the healthiest life possible. Among other steps, the bill would provide health insurance to millions of people living in states that have declined to expand their Medicaid programs; extend higher Child Tax Credit payments for a year and make those with no or low wages permanently eligible for the full amount; make major investments in affordable housing and child nutrition programs, and significantly increase access to child care services and paid leave benefits. These measures will truly help all Americans experience economic security and healthier lives during the pandemic and beyond.

      "content": "A new chewing gum that neutralizes the COVID-19 virus could help reduce its spread. According to press release by the University of Pennsylvania, scientists from several universities collaborated to create what they say is a low cost option that fights coronavirus. “SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the salivary glands, and we know that when someone who is infected sneezes, coughs, or speaks some of that virus can be expelled and reach others,” said lead researcher Henry Daniell of Penn’s School of Dental Medicine. “This gum offers an opportunity to neutralize the virus in the saliva, giving us a simple way to possibly cut down on a source of disease transmission.” Before the pandemic, Daniell had been researching a protein to help treat hypertension. His lab grew angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, using a patented plant-based production system. By bombarding plants with ACE2 DNA, they forced the chloroplasts to absorb and grow the proteins. By freeze-drying and grinding the material, the proteins could be delivered to patients. Daniell and Penn Dental Medicine colleague Hyun (Michel) Koo had also collaborated on research to develop a chewing gum infused with plant-grown proteins that disrupted dental plaque. The two suspected they were onto something, and contacted Ronald Collman at Penn Medicine to find out what a trial for a COVID-fighting chewing gum might look like. In before and after analyses of test swabs, the amount of virus present was drastically reduced after the gum triggered a reduction in viral load, according to a paper the team published in the journal Molecular Theory. In short: it seems to work. The press release says the gum may be of particular use in dental care, in a situation in which a patient needs to take off a mask to receive treatment. If chewing gum prior to the appointment reduces the chance of COVID spread, that’s an intriguing possibility. And maybe the gum could even tempt anti-vaxxers. If we’re lucky, they’ll make it taste like Dubble Bubble.

No matter who’s on your bench or who you might get on waivers this week, there’s no replacing Taylor’s production. … Michael Pittman Jr. has been a little quiet of late, yet he’s still 17th in WR scoring, so he’ll be missed.  Dolphins: Just when rookie Jaylen Waddle was rounding into a top 10 fantasy WR, he’ll sit this week out. For fantasy managers with Waddle on their roster, the good news is that Waddle comes back from the bye with a plus matchup against the Jets if you’re in the playoffs. Mike Gesicki is quietly the TE6 this season.Patriots: We’ve only talked about the skill positions in this series, but the Patriots happen to have the top fantasy kicker in Nick Folk and the top-scoring fantasy defense. Fantasy managers with Folk and/or the Patriots defense on their rosters haven’t had to deal with streaming this season, but this is the week to do it.Eagles: Amazingly, Jalen Hurts has been the second-leading fantasy QB this season and stands at fourth overall in fantasy scoring. Hurts’ accomplishments are all the more impressive, considering that no other Eagles offer much fantasy value. Miles Sanders might be missed, especially after a breakthrough in Week 13, though his health and inconsistency have made him less valuable. DeVonta Smith and TE Dallas Goedert may be regular starters, but they won’t be terribly missed.Week 14 waiver optionsSome fantasy squads might be deep enough to have a satisfactory fill-in on their bench when it comes to bye week replacements.

Whether or not Alvin Kamara is back, it’s worth playing Mark Ingram (who is still available in 30% of leagues) -- and you can even take a chance on Ty Montgomery, who averaged 5.25 yards on four carries last week vs. Dallas and added four receptions on seven targets. … Now that Clyde Edwards-Helaire is back and healthy for the Chiefs, check to see if Darrel Williams’s backup has foolishly been dropped in your league. All Williams did was produce 144 scrimmage yards and a receiving TD two weeks ago against the Raiders, who are this week’s opponent.Wide receiversThe Titans have allowed the most FPPG to wide receivers this season.

      "full_description": "The Buccaneers have two weeks to decide whether to keep or to cut receiver Antonio Brown . In 14 days, he returns from the three-game suspension imposed on him for giving the team, and in turn the league, a fake vaccination card. On Sunday, PFT reported that the Bucs are indeed considering the possibility of parting ways with Brown. If Brown were a bottom-of-the-roster player, he’d already be gone. Since he’s regarded as an important piece of the offense (the Bucs are 5-0 this year when he plays), it becomes difficult for a team that hopes to win the Super Bowl to voluntarily jettison a player with the skill to help them get there. On the other side of the ledger is the fact that Brown’s antics endangered people like coach Bruce Arians and 83-year-old offensive consultant Tom Moore. Arians is a three-time cancer survivor. Moore falls squarely into the segment of society most vulnerable to the worst possible outcome. Consider this. As noted by Peter King in the latest Football Morning in America column, Greg Auman of the TheAthletic.com noticed an interesting comment in Lars Anderson’s book about the 2020 Bucs, A Season in the Sun : “If any of you make me or Tom Moore sick, I have a gun and I will shoot you in the kneecaps .” And even if Arians, who made it clear when Brown was signed that he was on a clear one-strike arrangement , is inclined to look the other way, there’s a good chance Arians has been hearing it and will continue to keep hearing it from his family as to the reckless and selfish actions of Brown. Quarterback Tom Brady , who faced the media for the first time since Brown was suspended, didn’t comment on the fact that Brown lied about his vaccination status and endangered people like Arians and Moore. Instead, Brady views the situation as no different than a guy missing time due to injury. “I’m thinking about what I’ve got to do to help the team win,” Brady told reporters. “You know, different guys go down from injuries and so forth, and whether guys are out there or not, you know, I’ve got to do the best I can do. So just that’s what I’m going to do, be the best quarterback I can be.” Brady’s got one objective. To win. To win games and ultimately the Super Bowl. If he has a vote, they won’t be cutting Antonio Brown. With the Buccaneers organization so intent as a business proposition on keeping Brady around for as long as possible, Brady ultimately may have the controlling vote when the ballots are counted two weeks from today.",

Using iPads donated by Apple, students at select Boys & Girls Clubs will be able to access Apple's free Everyone Can Code curriculum alongside educators, allowing them to learn the basics of app design and development with Apple's programming language Swift. Apple said the program will initially launch at Boys & Girls Clubs in 10 regions, including Atlanta, Austin, the Washington D.C. metro area, Miami-Dade County, Wake County, the San Francisco Bay Area, and others. Programming is already available at clubs in Atlantic City, Chicago, Detroit, Nashville, and Newark, New Jersey. \"At Apple, we believe education is a force for equity, and that all learners should have the opportunity to explore and develop coding skills for their future,\" said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives.Tag: Everyone Can CodeThis article, \"Apple Partners With Boys & Girls Clubs to Provide Tens of Thousands of Kids With Opportunity to Learn How to Code\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",
